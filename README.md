# ADM - Homework1

## In this repository you'll find the PDF printout of the exercises I've done (inside the stamps folder) and a .py file containing the code I used to solve them. 
### N.B. I didn't manage to do a few exercises from the categories "Collections" and "Regex", the others should all be there. 
### You can also notice that some exercises, especially the ones I did during the first week, might be a little "over-commented" regarding the way I solved them; I don't know if that's ok, but I left the comments there as a testament to my mental process as a beginner programmer

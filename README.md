# ADM - Homework1

## In this repository you'll find the PDF printout of the exercises I've done (inside the stamps folder) and a .py file containing the code I used to solve them. 
#### N.B. I didn't manage to do a few exercises from the categories "Collections" and "Regex", the others should all be there.
#### You might also notice that some exercises, especially the ones I completed during the first week, might be a little "over-commented" regarding the way I solved them (nothing too extreme, just some brief considerations on why a piece of code worked or didn't work and/or why I had to solve the exercises in a certain way); I don't know if that's ok, but I left the comments as a testament to my mental process as a beginner programmer
